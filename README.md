This is a graphical version of the game 2048. For context, 2048 is a popular sliding block game first made by Gabriele Cirulli. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048 (or more). In this project, I used Java and it was made in Eclipse. The game is made using threads as they are able to interact with shared resources, and communication is possible between multiple threads. As one of the requirements was for the board to update, threads were really useful in updating loops. Once the user starts the application, there will be three buttons, "play", "scores", and "Exit Game." In order to play the game, the user should click on "play" and the game will start. While playing the game, your score and the time elapsed will be continiously updated until the user loses. Upon losing, your score and time will be recoreded. Additionally, there will be three options: "Back to Main Menu", "Quit" and "Restart". "Back to Main Menu" takes you back to the original panel on the application. On the main menu, the user can also check out their top scores and fastest times by clicking scores, they can also exit the application using the "Exit Game" game button. "Quit" will exit the application, and "Restart" will start the game up again so the user can play again.
